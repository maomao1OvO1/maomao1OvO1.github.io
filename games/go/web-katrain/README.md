# Web KaTrain

Web KaTrain is a browser-based Go study app inspired by
[KaTrain](https://github.com/sanderland/katrain). It runs KataGo-style neural
network evaluation locally in the browser with TensorFlow.js, keeps the search
work off the main thread in a Web Worker, and can be installed as an offline
PWA. There is no analysis server to run.

**Live app:** https://sir-teo.github.io/web-katrain/

## Highlights

**Analyze games**

- Top-move hints, principal variations, ownership, policy, win rate, and score
  lead.
- Quick, fast, and full-game analysis passes with per-position caching.
- KaTrain-style move quality, phase summaries, and game reports.

**Study and play**

- Play against browser KataGo with KaTrain-style AI strategies: `default`,
  `rank`, `scoreloss`, `policy`, `weighted`, `pick`, `local`, `tenuki`,
  `territory`, `influence`, `jigo`, `simple`, and `settle`.
- Teach mode, byo-yomi clocks, resign/pass handling, manual scoring, and 9x9,
  13x13, or 19x19 boards.
- Branching move trees with notes, setup stones, markup, and SGF-compatible
  export.
- Study tools: interactive fundamentals lessons, a score-estimation quiz, a
  "climb the ranks" tournament ladder against calibrated bots, and a
  searchable pro game library. Open any of them from the menu's Study &
  Practice section or the command palette.

**Load and save**

- Import SGF files by picker, paste, drag and drop, or Online-Go game URL.
- Import board positions from a photo or live camera capture, or reconstruct a
  game from a top-down board video (beta).
- Store games in an IndexedDB library with folders, bundled famous games, and
  zip backup/restore.
- Auto-save the current session and recover after a crash or reload.

**Use it anywhere**

- Responsive desktop and mobile layouts.
- Board themes, UI themes, keyboard shortcuts, command palette, gamepad
  navigation, sound, and haptics.
- UI language options for English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, French, German,
  Spanish, and Italian.
- Offline app shell, default model, TensorFlow.js WASM files, and board assets
  are cached by the production service worker.

## Quick Start

Use Node.js 24 or newer for the closest match to CI.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The first dev or production build may take a moment. The `predev` and
`prebuild` hooks copy TensorFlow.js WASM files into `public/tfjs/` and ensure
the small KataGo test model exists at `public/models/katago-small.bin.gz`.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server with COOP/COEP headers. |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite. |
| `npm run test:typecheck` | Type-check the tests. |
| `npm run test:viewport` | Run the Chrome viewport smoke test. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint. |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build the production app. |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally with preview headers. |

## Models and Performance

The bundled model is a tiny KataGo test network, about 3.6 MB compressed, so the
app can boot quickly on ordinary laptops and phones. It is useful for smoke
testing and casual UI work, not strong analysis.

For real analysis, Settings offers the recommended browser-practical b18
network:

`kata1-b18c384nbt-s9996604416-d4316597426.bin.gz` (~96 MB)

You can also enter a KataGo model URL or upload `.bin`, `.gz`, or `.bin.gz`
weights for the session. The parser supports KataGo model versions 8 through
16. Uploaded browser models are capped at 128 MB.

The engine prefers TensorFlow.js WebGPU, then falls back to WASM, then CPU.
Threaded WASM needs `SharedArrayBuffer`, which browsers only expose when the
page is cross-origin isolated:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Vite dev and preview send these headers. The production build includes
`public/_headers` for hosts that honor it. GitHub Pages still works without
custom headers, but WASM runs single-threaded there; WebGPU is unaffected.
